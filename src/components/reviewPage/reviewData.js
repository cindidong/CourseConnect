      paragraph: "First of all, Nachenberg is the only professor I've ever had that actually doesn't make me fall asleep in class. His slides have jump scare sound effects and he throws candy at you if you participate in class, so his class is definitely like no other class at UCLA. This class teaches data structures which is REALLY IMPORTANT to prepare you for a career in software. His lecture slides are impeccable, and on the few days I missed lecture, going through his slides was enough to catch up. Just make sure to start project 3 and project 4 at least a week early because those are really time consuming (25 hours each total). If you're following his examples in lecture, you'll be fine for the midterms and finals, besides they're only worth 15% each which is about the same as project 3 and 4. "

        paragraph: "AVOID THIS CLASS IF YOU CAN IT'S NOT WORTH IT. This class has a very light workload (5-8 questions from the textbook due every week) but the tests are insanely difficult. The average for the class was around a 60% and he didn't prepare us with the appropriate topics to do well on the test and 90% of your grade are the midterm and final. He emphasizes certain concepts in class that are never tested, and tests on concepts he briefly mentioned for 5 minutes in lecture. Definitely go to his office hours because he's really helpful and explains things much better than in lecture, and do the discussion worksheets."
