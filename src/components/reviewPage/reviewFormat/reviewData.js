      paragraph: "First of all, Nachenberg is the only professor I've ever had that actually doesn't make me fall asleep in class. His slides have jump scare sound effects and he throws candy at you if you participate in class, so his class is definitely like no other class at UCLA. This class teaches data structures which is REALLY IMPORTANT to prepare you for a career in software. His lecture slides are impeccable, and on the few days I missed lecture, going through his slides was enough to catch up. Just make sure to start project 3 and project 4 at least a week early because those are really time consuming (25 hours each total). If you're following his examples in lecture, you'll be fine for the midterms and finals, besides they're only worth 15% each which is about the same as project 3 and 4. "

        paragraph: "AVOID THIS CLASS IF YOU CAN IT'S NOT WORTH IT. This class has a very light workload (5-8 questions from the textbook due every week) but the tests are insanely difficult. The average for the class was around a 60% and he didn't prepare us with the appropriate topics to do well on the test and 90% of your grade are the midterm and final. He emphasizes certain concepts in class that are never tested, and tests on concepts he briefly mentioned for 5 minutes in lecture. Definitely go to his office hours because he's really helpful and explains things much better than in lecture, and do the discussion worksheets."

        paragraph: "In a nutshell, TAKE THIS CLASS. CAREY IS GREAT! Carey really makes CS32 enjoyable. His teaching style is efficient and encourages engagement, his slides are immensely beneficial, and most importantly, he is just such a nice guy that you would never regret to get to know him. The workload for this class is totally manageable. Some of the projects might take a little bit more time than others (like project 3 and 4), but all of them are super-well designed (beside a few mistakes in the spec) and are extremely helpful in consolidating the materials covered in class. Both of the midterms are easy (I believe the mean for both of the midterm was somewhere around 90%). The only downside of this class is that since final is held on the weekend of week 10 and project 4 is also due week 10, you probably don't have that much time to study for the final. Overall, I extremely recommend this class, especially for those who thinks Professor Smallberg's lectures are a little bit too slow. Take this class, and you would not regret it."

I thought all the projects were relatively straightforward and easy to complete, and the TAs and professors are more than happy to help you with any problems. The lectures were very boring, but they were bruincasted, and you can just run through them at 2x so it's not too bad. Discussion aren't mandatory, and there isn't much reason to go unless you're really have trouble with the material or with the project for the week. The midterm was pretty easy, and it had an average of ~82%."

All the lectures were bruincasted, attendance was not mandatory, and we could choose which discussion we wanted to attend, so scheduling was very flexible. Projects could take a bit of time, especially near the end, but office hours were very helpful. He can talk a bit slow, but he is overall a extremely reasonable professor and will try his best to help you succeed."

        paragraph: "Stahl is possibly the worst instructor I've ever had. Don't take this class if you are not a CS major, as his teaching and grading method is geared toward students who already know the material. His lectures are terrible, he codes in Microsoft OneNote during class and his code is broken and full of spelling errors (because he doesn't use an IDE). His notes are fragmented and incomprehensible, and his tests are ridiculous. The final was 25 pages. His projects take HOURS to complete, and if you don't score well enough on the exams, your project grade is reduced. He is impatient and brushes you off during OH. Honestly, this was my only B- and it was warmly welcomed just to get me out of this class."

        paragraph: "Beware of this class! 35L drained so much of my time, so make sure to schedule your quarter appropriately. As others have stated, there needs to be some restructuring. This class had 2 lab sections per week, with a lab assignment due at the beginning of each week. Attendance for these sections is not mandatory, and usefulness depends on ur TA. Labs 2, 4, 5, and 9 were especially time consuming for me, and all the other labs were still either difficult or annoying af. I turned in most of the labs late, so my lab average was about an 82. I did feel like I learned a lot from trying to do the labs, but this did not help at all for the final lmao. I pulled up with textbooks and hundreds of pages of notes and scored around the median (52), which got me a B. The final was 17 PAGES of the hardest stuff ever. Each of the 10 questions were weighted equally and had to do with one of the labs. I straight up left a question blank after reading the directions and totally guessed on the multiple choice. There were basically no free points at all, so good luck on that lmao. 3 units does not correspond at all to the necessary workload of this course, and after hours and hours of work I escaped with a B. This class also takes hella time away from all your other courses, so be ready for that."

So, it will be tough and don't get behind."
